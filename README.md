  - OS-Kernel interaction, System Calls
  - File editing and handling in C, C++ (GNU) 

## Demo 
> Yet to be added

- Compile using the make file 
- Run on the current shell using : ./editor

> Screencast to be added

## Dev Updates Tracker
> :construction_worker_man: DEVELOPMENTS AHEAD
- [x] v0.1 - Read/Write from/to file
- [ ] v0.2 - Find in file
- [ ] v0.3 - Syntax Highlighting

## Tech Stack 
> C++ (std 17)
> CMake (GNU Make v4.3)

## Dependencies 
- GNU Compiler Collection (GNU-CC) 
- Alternatively one can use other G++/C++ standard ports too like Cygwin
- Most of the calls/libraries used are standard in nature and can be easily found in the latest implementations of C++ compilers
- Calls do not stick to POSIX compliancy (ignore any hard details on that)

## Thoughts and Future developments
- This is memorable : my first large project and a fairly comprehensive programming experience
- First project that has working utility
- But no future works/developments to be made
  - This project is really archaic and old
  - Nothing of interest will probably come out of this

## Notes 

- This is a Hobby Project meant for educational purposes and not meant for commercial usage.
- Credits to the original author and contributors of ConsolEditor be given in updates/copies/forks of this project.
